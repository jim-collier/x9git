.SYNOPSIS
    Sets up a gitsby development environment (PowerShell edition).
.DESCRIPTION
    Clones the repo, checks out the 'dev' branch, and checks the tooling. Shows
    the plan and asks first. Requires PowerShell 7+ and git. Meant for one-liner use:
        irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install-dev.ps1 | iex
    With options:
        & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install-dev.ps1))) -Directory ~/dev/gitsby -Yes
.PARAMETER Directory
    Where to clone to (default: ./gitsby).
.PARAMETER Yes
    Don't ask for confirmation.

# History:
#   - 20260722 JC: Created.
#   - 20260724 JC: Option-shaped -Directory rejected; named parameters throughout; trailing blank line.
#   - 20260727 JC: Body wrapped in a function, for the same reasons as install.ps1: a
#     decline no longer ends the caller's session, StrictMode no longer leaks into it, and a
#     non-tty stdin refuses rather than cloning unasked. PowerShell 7 checked up front.
