#!/usr/bin/env bash

##	Purpose:
##		- Downloads and installs the latest gitsby release, after showing the plan
##		  and asking first. Meant for one-liner use:
##		      curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install.bash | bash
##		  Flags go after 'bash -s --', e.g.:
##		      ... | bash -s -- --system -y
##		- Runs on bash 3.2+ (stock macOS bash), so no bash-4/5 features in here.
##	History: At bottom of script.

	Usage: install.bash [OPTIONS]
	Downloads and installs gitsby (with confirmation).
	Options:
	  --release dev|stable   Latest release (default), or the tip of the dev branch.
	  --target user|system   Install for you (~/.local/bin, default) or everyone (/usr/local/bin).
	  --arch x64|amd64|arm64 Accepted for consistency with other installers, and has no effect
	                         here: gitsby is a shell script, so one file runs everywhere.
	  -r, --ref REF          A specific branch, tag, or commit. Skips checksum verification.
	  -y, --yes              Don't ask for confirmation.
	  -h, --help             This.

##	History:
##		- 20260722 JC: Created.
##		- 20260724 JC: Latest-release lookup via the releases/latest redirect (API scrape is now the rate-limited fallback); release-asset downloads verify against a SHA256SUMS asset when published; trailing blank line.
##		- 20260727 JC: Options now spelled --release, --target and --arch, to match the other installers. -s/--system and --ref still work.
##		- 20260812 JC: The plan says whether the download will be checked, before it is agreed to. It was reported only afterwards, and on the --release dev path not at all - so the one route that installs an unverified file was the quiet one.
