.SYNOPSIS
    Downloads and installs the latest gitsby release (PowerShell edition).
.DESCRIPTION
    Shows the plan and asks first. Requires PowerShell 7+. Meant for one-liner use:
        irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install.ps1 | iex
    With options:
        & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jim-collier/gitsby/main/install.ps1))) -System -Yes
.PARAMETER Release
    Which build: 'stable' (the latest release, default) or 'dev' (the tip of the dev branch).
.PARAMETER Target
    'user' for a per-user install (default), or 'system' for all users.
.PARAMETER Arch
    Accepted for consistency with other installers, and has no effect here: gitsby is a
    script, so the same file runs on every architecture.
.PARAMETER System
    Install for all users. The same thing as -Target system.
.PARAMETER Yes
    Don't ask for confirmation.
.PARAMETER Ref
    Install from a specific branch/tag/commit instead of the latest release.

# History:
#   - 20260722 JC: Created.
#   - 20260724 JC: Latest-release lookup via the releases/latest redirect (API scrape
#     is now the rate-limited fallback); random private temp dir; shebang sanity check;
#     release-asset downloads verify against a SHA256SUMS asset when published; named
#     parameters throughout; trailing blank line.
#   - 20260727 JC: Options now spelled -Release, -Target and -Arch, to match the other
#     installers. -System and -Ref still work.
#   - 20260727 JC: Body wrapped in a function: as top-level text the param() block never
#     bound (its ValidateSet validated its own empty default and died), a decline ended the
#     caller's session, and StrictMode leaked into it. Refuses at EOF instead of proceeding.
#     PowerShell 7 is now checked before anything reads $IsWindows.
#   - 20260728 JC: The failed-download message names '-Release dev', like install.bash's does. It used to send you to the Bash installer, which resolves the same stale release and fails the same way.
#   - 20260731 JC: SHA256SUMS is decoded from bytes before it's read. GitHub serves it as
#     octet-stream, so the response body arrived as a byte array and no checksum was ever
#     found - the default install path had been unverified since the check was added.
#   - 20260812 JC: The plan says whether the download will be checked, and on Windows that the
#     install directory is about to be added to PATH - which it now is. Nothing else on Windows
#     puts it there, so the install used to finish with a program that could not be run by name.
#     PATHEXT is deliberately left alone: PowerShell resolves a bare name to a .ps1 on PATH
#     without it, and it would only affect cmd.exe, which cannot run one regardless.
